  <p>Motivation is loud in the beginning. Discipline is quiet — but it stays.</p>

  <p>Most people wait to feel ready. They wait for confidence, energy, or the perfect moment. But life doesn’t move for feelings. It moves for action.</p>

  <p>Discipline is choosing to show up when you’re tired, when nobody is watching, and when progress feels slow.</p>

  <p>You don’t need to change your whole life today. Just keep one promise to yourself today.</p>

  <p><strong>Lean on discipline — it won’t abandon you.</strong></p>
