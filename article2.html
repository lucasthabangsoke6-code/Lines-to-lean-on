<section class="content">
  <p>Many people don’t struggle to find love. They struggle to feel safe in it.</p>

  <p>Healthy love feels calm. Not boring — calm. It doesn’t make you beg or abandon yourself.</p>

  <p>Before asking why someone doesn’t choose you, ask if you are choosing yourself.</p>

  <p>The relationship you want starts with the one you have with yourself.</p>

  <p><strong>Lean on self-worth. Love follows safety.</strong></p>
